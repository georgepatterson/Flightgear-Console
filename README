FlightGear-Console is a private repository of test code and works-in-progress. 

While we are ensuring that the code works, at this stage it is not
possible to check the quality of the code. Feel Free to make suggestions
about the code and we will add them at the right time.

Current issues.

- The data routing is very crude with no way to specify where a piece of
    data is expected to be sent.
- Some of the bugs are rather insidious due to the crude code in the sArduino.
- The firmware in the Arduino needs to be reworked to be more robust.

Requirements

- Python 2.4/2.5 or later
- Pyserial

You also need to grab Flightgear.py from the flightgear cvs repository.

While this file may be incomplete, this code is in a state of flux and
subject to change. Please drop a line if this is not clear as it's
possible that an improved version is in the pipeline.

Still needed to document the protocol though the S-Expressions are
fairly straight forward.
