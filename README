FlightGear-Console is a private repository of test code and works-in-progress. 

While we are ensuring that the code works, at this stage it is not possible to check the quality of the code.
Feel Free to make suggestion on the code and we will add them at the right time.

Current issues.

- The data routing is very crude with no way to specify where a piece of data is expected to be sent.
- Some of the bugs are rather insidious due to the crude code in the Arduino.
- The firmware in the Arduino needs to be reworked to be more rebust.
